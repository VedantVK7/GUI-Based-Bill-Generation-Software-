# GUI-Based-Supermarket-Billing-Software-
Hello everyone!. I have developed a java application for automated bill generation. I have developed this as a micro-project for my academics. This software has database connectivity. I have used MySql database for managing bills & supermarket products. The software consists of 4 files. The HomePage.java is the main class & other are dialog boxes. The product information is stored in the database and dynamically fetched into the software. The billing records history is also maintained in the database and can be viewed through the software. After the bill generation, there is an option to print that bill. Used java.awt.print package for making the bill printable.
This software supports adding product for billing, removing the product, updating its quantity. Enter customer name & phone number, then select product from thi drop-down list. Choose product & then choose its type(varient) from another drop-down list & then clock 'Add Product' button for adding the product. For changing quantity of product, change the quantity from JTable cell & hit enter. Then press the 'Change Quantity' Button for updating the amount. 
The bill is generated after clicking 'Generate Bill' button. Enter the amount paid by customer then the generated bill will be displayed.
After bill generation, the billing data is recorded into database & there's an option to print that bill.
